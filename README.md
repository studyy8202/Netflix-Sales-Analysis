## Insights Summary

**Sales**

- From 2021 to 2023, Standard and Standard_ads brought in the most revenue with 5.159k and 5.310k, respectively. Premium plan only brought in less than 20 percent of weekly sales.
- Sales from all subscription plans experienced a significant drop in the first week of 2003. Investigate whether it is an external cause or internal cause (e.g., server error).

**Region**

- North America has the most sales, and the figures outperform all other regions. Other regions have relatively the same sales figures, with East Asia having the lowest sales.
- All regions experienced a very negative trend during the start of 2023 with North America receiving the most loss in sales.

## Recommendations

- Investigate why there was a large dip at the start of 2023. Find out whether it is because of COVID, market expectations, or internal issues such as server error. Include several years to see if the issue is consistent across time. Is there any improvement on the service that can combat this dip?
- East Asia has the lowest sales ever, even though this region has a very large market. Find out are there any features that can attract more consumers to that market. Example can be more Asian movies or animations.
- Premium plan can have a large impact on sales, so consider adding promotions or features to make the plan more appealing.
